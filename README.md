Recreated the Plants Vs. ZombiesTM game by PopCap Games for my second year software engineering project at Western University. Coded in C++ in Qt Creator IDE.

This repo is not the completed version, but does feature:

- A user system (add new players that can be playing at their own pace rather than using your player game record)
- A point system(collecting randombly falling suns)
- Various players to choose from 
- Various enemy zombies characters that appear based on level played
